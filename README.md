# Lil Weirdo

## Summary

This is a Discord bot which occasionally interjects into conversations with LLM generated goodness. It is highly configurable. It is intended for single guild use and currently applies its configuration across all guilds.

As of 3/18/2024, this is the help message generated by the bot:



## How to use

1. First, install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) on an accessible server. Then [follow Discord.py's instructions for generating a Discord bot account](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html#creating-a-bot-account) and take note of the bot's token.

2. Install the `lilweirdo` project as an editable Python project any way you'd like. I recommend creating a virtual environment and installing it into the venv as such:

    ```
    python -m venv env/
    . env/bin/activate
    pip install -e .
    ```

    However, you're welcome to use `pipx` (`pipx install --editable .`) or any equivalent command.

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project, and populate it with your secrets:

    ```
    DISCORD_TOKEN=<paste your bot token here>
    OLLAMA_HOST=<optional, place alternative Ollama host URL here>
    ```

4. In your virtual environment, start the bot by invoking the `lilweirdo` binary or by running `python src/main.py` from the root directory.

5. Invite your bot to your server [by following the instructions provided by Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html#inviting-your-bot).

## How to add your own sickos

Check out the bottom of `src/templater.py`. This is where all the `Template`s are stored, which are given by a prompt template + a choice of LLM model + a choice of stop token. 

An example `Template` is given here:

```py
LIL_WEIRDO = Templater(
    template="""
You are Lil Weirdo, and you are hellishly mean. You are also fantastic at writing insults.

The following conversations are some assholes talking. All of them are fucking dickheads. Each message will start with [MSG] and end with [/MSG]. Here's what these fuckers said:

{{ .Prompt }}
""",
    stoptokens=c.STOP_TOKENS,
    modelname="mistral",
    modeltag="latest"
)
```

Make sure to supply at least the set of stop tokens given by `c.STOP_TOKENS`. Conversation history will be filled into the prompt template overtop the `{{ .Prompt }}` variable. Each message in the conversation will start with an `[MSG]` tag and will end with an `[/MSG]` tag. This currently cannot be configured -- so if you want to provide the bot with some example conversations, make sure you enclose the example messages with these tags.

Once you've generated the `Template`, add it to the bot by adding an extra entry to `discordweirdo.DiscordWeirdo.sickos` by editing `discordweirdo.DiscordWeirdo.__init__`. You may either choose `keeper.ConvoKeeper` or `keeper.PeopleKeeper` as the sicko's memory. The former records entire conversations, the latter records peoples' individual message histories. Neither group memories by channel, so clutter may build up in the sickos' memories if `keeper.ConvoKeeper` is used. 

Easier ways to add a sicko will come soon, along with more memory keepers and extra configuration options.
